/**
Project Euler problem# 5:
2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

Below is an efficient solution of above problem using C++. Time complexity in the random access machine model is O(n log log n)
operations, a direct consequence of the fact that the prime harmonic series asymptotically approaches log log n.
